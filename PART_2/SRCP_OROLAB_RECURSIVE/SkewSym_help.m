% function [x_skew] = SkewSym(x)
% Computes the skew-symmetric matrix of a vector, which is also the
% left-hand-side matricial equivalent of the vector cross product
%
% [x_skew] = SkewSym(x)
%
% :parameters:
%	* x -- [3x1] column matrix (the vector).
%
% :return:
%	* x_skew -- [3x3] skew-symmetric matrix of x.
