% This README file provides instructions for using the MATLAB script "Main.m"
% and associated scripts/functions.
% Please follow the guidelines below to ensure a smooth execution of the program.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Prerequisites

% Before running the scripts, make sure that the Symbolic Math Toolbox Add-On
% is installed on your computer. If you don't have the add-on,
% you can find and install it by following these steps:
% 
% 1.Open MATLAB.
% 2.Go to the Home tab.
% 3.In the Environment section, click the Add-Ons icon.
% 4.The Add-On Explorer will open, displaying a list of available add-ons.
% 5.Search for "Symbolic Math Toolbox" and click on it.
% 6.Follow the on-screen instructions to install the add-on.
% 7.Ensure that you have an active internet connection to download and install the add-on.

% Running the script (GUI)

% In order to have a fully immersive experience please just type 'Main' 
% in the command window and let it guide you.

% Button description

% 1. Computation of HCW equations with different initial conditions
%    When pressed the program will ask simulation time as an input and plot
%    the relative motion of the deputy w.r.t. the chief
%  
% 2. Start the optimiziation problem
%    When pressed the program will ask initial condition and comupte
%    optimization calculations for a specific problem involving 
%    the rendezvous maneuver between a deputy spacecraft and a target
% 3. Start the game simulator
%    When pressed a gamelike realtime simulator of the rendezvous will
%    start
% 4. Run Robotic Manipulator Simulation
%    When pressed it simulates the evolution in time of angular and linear
%    momentum and the position of the center of mass.
% 5. Run Robotic Manipulator Animation
%    When pressed it generates an animation regarding the evolution of the
%    robotic arm.
% 6. close menu
%    When pressed it closes the program

% RUNNING THE SCRIPT (obsolete)
% To launch the MATLAB script "Main.m" and execute the associated functionality,
% please follow these steps:
% 
% 1. Open MATLAB.
% 2. Open the "Main.m" script in the MATLAB editor.
% 3. Press the 'Run' button in the MATLAB editor toolbar.
% 4. The Command Window will display a menu with numbered options.
% 5. Enter a number to select your choice from the menu.
% 6. Press Enter to confirm your selection.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Providing Inputs

% If a script requires additional inputs, the Command Window will display
% a message requesting the required input.
% 1. Type the input with the proper format as instructed.
% 2. Press Enter to confirm your input.
% 3. For more detailed information about each individual script or function,
% please refer to the corresponding help files.
% 
% Game Simulator and Animation
% When running game simulator and animation scripts, they will open in a separate window.
% Please note that this window will take up the entire screen.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Switching between Scripts/Functions

% Once you have made a choice using the "Main.m" script
% (as described in step 5 of "Running the Script"),
% the associated script/function will start executing.
% At the end of each script, the "Main.m" script will be closed.
% If you wish to select another command that performs a different script/function,
% you will need to relaunch the "Main.m" script.
% 
% Thank you for using our MATLAB scripts!
% If you encounter any issues or have any questions,
% please refer to the documentation or contact our team.
